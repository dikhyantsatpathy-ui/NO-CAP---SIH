"""
Module 4 — Face Verification (SIH26188 "AI-Based Fake Identity & Document
Screening"). Closes "valid document, wrong person": compare the face in the
document against the holder's live capture.

The document-side face is a face ROI cropped from the document image (Module
3's zone boxes). The live capture is a webcam frame uploaded at the desk.
Matches the face_match.compare_faces contract: {score, match (True|False|None),
method, detail}. `match=None` means "inconclusive — confirm by eye"; the desk
never treats a low-signal comparison as a pass.
